# Dataflow processor interpreter

An interpreter for MIT's tagged token data flow architecutre.

# Reading
The [`reading/`](reading/) folder contains links to useful paper. In general,
the links revolve around:

- The MIT tagged token architecture
- The `Id` programming language

I've also been looking for the book "Data flow computing: theory and practice",
but have been unable to find it (at a reasonable price: Amazon is ~ $150)
